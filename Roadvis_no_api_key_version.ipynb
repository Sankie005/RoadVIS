    "I've tried my best to make this as easy as possible to run but ideally i'd really like it if you got on call and we were able to demo it for you, we already ship the best.pt file so there is no need to train the model, please create and use a python 3.11 virtual environment with ipykernel to run it, if you have further questions or get an error at anypoint, please reach out to me at sankritya0@gmail.com\n",
    "Furthermore i'm unfortunately not able to share the source code for our roboflow integration as it has our personal API keys present and as per the guidelines we are restricted from sharing these with anyone else apart from our team, thanks for understanding. \n",
